What kind of value does the function getFirstVowel return?
- an optional string

Of the three ways that you unwrapped the value of firstVowel, which do you feel was most appropriate for this situation, and why?
- I liked the ! because it was the shortest and the cleanest. But the best one to use might be the let one because it allows you to add an else if there is no vowel

This exercise assumes that you do, in fact, have a vowel (of the English language) in your name. What, if anything, would you need to change about the code if your name was "Bj√∏rk" or "Ghrftnx"?
- you would need an else saying that if there is no vowels to print something saying "you have no vowels in your name!"
